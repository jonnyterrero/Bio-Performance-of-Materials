## Topics in the visualization

1. **Signal chain** — measurand → sensor → conditioner → galvanic isolation → ADC → DSP → display.
2. **IEC 60601** — isolation barrier as a patient-safety requirement, not an optional analog block.
3. **System transfer function** — under matched, LTI stages, \(V_{display} \propto K_{sensor}\,G_{amp}\,H_{filter}(s)\,K_{ADC}\,M\).
4. **Nonlinearity note** — thermistors (and similar sensors) break the linear-gain assumption; the processor must invert Steinhart–Hart / LUT maps before display.
